<h3>Basic Information About Migration:</h3>
<p>Migration is a common activity that involves the movement of people from one place to another.
Humans have always migrated, and still migrate today. There are many causes of migration.
People may migrate to a specific place because they choose to. Some examples of this are
moving to somewhere for a better job, or because of the change of the season. People may
also be forced out of a place and must move to somewhere else. Some examples of people being forced
out of a country include persecution, war, natural disasters, and more. People will keep moving
as long as they live on Earth.</p>
