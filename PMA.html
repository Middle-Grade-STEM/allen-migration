<h3>Basic Overview:</h3>

<p>During the 17th century, English puritans migrated across the Atlantic to New England in the Americas.
During this period of time, there was religious persecution in England, so they went to the Americas. There were also
better economic oppurtunities in New England. There were many challenges along the way like sailing across
the Atlantic Ocean with 17th century technology and interacting with Native Americans once they reached New England.</p>

<h3>Push Factors</h3>

<p>Push Factors are the reasons that people leave a place. Some examples of push factors are leaving because of war,
persecution, natural disasters, etc. The main thing that pushed people out of England was the religious persecution.
In England, some people wanted to seperate or avoid the Church of England and have more religious freedome, but that was not
allowed. The group made a deal with the Plymouth Company who promised to finance their trip to North America to establish a
colony. In return, the colony would repay the company by harvesting supplies, such as fur, timber and fish,
to send back to England.</p>

<h3>Pull Factors</h3>

<p>Pull factors are the reasons that people go to a specific place. Some examples of pull factors are going to a place because of,
better healthcare, better jobs, religious freedom, etc. The two main things that pulled people out of England to New England were
more religious freedom and more economic oppurtunities. In New England, the people could follow whatever religion they want and
are more free in their choices. The better life in America really attracted the people living a harsh life in England.</p>
