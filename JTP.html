<h3>Basic Overview:</h3>

<p>During the 20th century, Jews were discriminated and treated very harshly because of their religion.
This cause many Jewish people all across Europe to flee to Palestine and the Zionist Congress was created.
There were many challenges along the way such as getting rejected wherever they went and fighting in a
war against Arabs in Palestine.</p>

<h3>Push Factors:</h3>

<p>Push Factors are the reasons that people leave a place. Some examples of push factors are leaving because of war,
persecution, natural disasters, etc. The main thing that pushed the Jewish people out of countries across Europe
was that they were persecuted for being Jewish. An event that pushed Jews out of Western Europe was the Dreyfus
Affair. This was when a Jew named Alfred Dreyfus was falsely accused to commiting horrible crimes. In Eastern Europe,
the assassination of Tsar Alexander II and the rollback of his inclusive laws in 1882 caused many Jews to flee to Palestine.</p>

<h3>Pull Factors:</h3>

<p>Pull factors are the reasons that people go to a specific place. Some examples of pull factors are going to a place because of,
better healthcare, better jobs, religious freedom, etc. The main thing that pulled the Jewish people into Palestine was Zionism.
In 1897, Drefus, after being falsely accused of crimes during the Dreyfus Affair, started the First Zionist Congress in Palestine.
There was religious freedom and many Jews like the idea of Zionism. Many Jews from all across Europe came to Palestine to escape
persecution and discrimination.</p>
